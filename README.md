# Medicare - Hospital Management System

**Medicare** is a full-stack hospital management system built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The system is designed to manage various operations of a hospital such as patient registration, appointment scheduling, billing, and more. It provides an intuitive interface for doctors, patients, and administrators to handle their respective tasks efficiently.

## Features

- **Patient Management**: Register new patients, maintain personal details, and view medical history.
- **Appointment Scheduling**: Patients can book, modify, or cancel appointments; doctors can view their schedules.
- **Billing System**: Automatically generate bills based on patient treatment and services provided.
- **Inventory Management**: Track hospital inventory like medicines and equipment.
- **User Authentication**: Role-based access for administrators, doctors, and patients using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- **Responsive UI**: Accessible on both mobile and desktop devices.

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing patient records, appointments, and other data.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js, handling routing and server-side logic.
- **React.js**: Front-end library for building the user interface.
- **Node.js**: Back-end JavaScript runtime for handling requests and connecting to the database.
